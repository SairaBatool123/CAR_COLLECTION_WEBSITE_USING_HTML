    <p><b>Supercar brands</b> have proven to be surprisingly resilient in the face of the economic hardships brought
        about by the COVID-19 pandemic and the global semiconductor chip shortage. <br> Lamborghini is no exception,
        with the Italy-based carmaker delivering a total of 8,405 cars in 2022, up 13% from 2020. However, perhaps in
        part to the multiple model options and still-existing supply shortages in some market sectors, the models list
        has been trimmed with some enthusiasm for 2023.The Huracan, perhaps the best selling of all the current
        Lamborghini models, has been slashed down from 6 EVO variants and the STO to 4 models total: The STO, the EVO
        Spyder, the Technica, and the limited edition Sterrato. The regular coupe EVO was available up until the end of
        Q1 2023, after which the last remaining EVO model is the Spyder. <br>
        The flagship Aventador, the darling of the past decade for Lamborghini, has been shuffled off to the legacy
        collection, replaced by the 2024 Revuelto. Roughly meaning "revolution," the new V12 flagship is the first
        non-limited series Lamborghini to offer a full performance hybrid powertrain, to the point that it reaches
        hypercar levels of power at 1,001 HP. The 6.5L V12 also now redlines at close to 9,500, and is supported by an
        independent electrical motor on each of the two front wheels, and one in the 8-speed transaxle that acts as a
        torque fill and power boost during shifting and launches, respectively. <br>
        Less hypercar-level versions of the Revuelto are expected to be announced through Q3 and Q4 of 2023, with orders
        and production likely to start in 2024, and the limited series Countach LPI 800-4 will start deliveries t
        customers early summer of this year. On the Super-SUV side, the Urus has had its base model discontinued in
        North America, now only offering the Urus S and Urus Performante models. <br>
        With all this trimming, Lamborghini has a consolidated list of models for every important sector of the
        high-performance market: Super-SUV, hypercar, and supercar with the Urus, Revuelto, and Huracan respectively.

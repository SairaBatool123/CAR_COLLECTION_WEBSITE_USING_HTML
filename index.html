            <p id="car1"><strong>Lamborghini HuracÃ¡n</strong><br>Supercar brands have proven to be surprisingly
                resilient in
                the face of the economic hardships brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic and the global semiconductor
                chip shortage. Lamborghini is no exception, with the Italy-based carmaker delivering a total of 8,405
                cars in 2022, up 13% from 2020. However, perhaps in part to the multiple model options and
                still-existing supply shortages in some market sectors, the models list has been trimmed with some
                enthusiasm for 2023.</p>

            <br>
            <p id="car2"><strong>Lamborghini Urus</strong><br>Less hypercar-level versions of the Revuelto are expected
                to be
                announced through Q3 and Q4 of 2023, with orders and production likely to start in 2024, and the limited
                series Countach LPI 800-4 will start deliveries to customers early summer of this year. On the Super-SUV
                side, the Urus has had its base model discontinued in North America, now only offering the Urus S and
                Urus Performante models.</p>

            <br>
            <p id="car3"><strong>Lamborghini Revuelto</strong><br>The flagship Aventador, the darling of the past decade
                for
                Lamborghini, has been shuffled off to the legacy collection, replaced by the 2024 Revuelto. Roughly
                meaning "revolution," the new V12 flagship is the first non-limited series Lamborghini to offer a full
                performance hybrid powertrain, to the point that it reaches hypercar levels of power at 1,001 HP. The
                6.5L V12 also now redlines at close to 9,500, and is supported by an independent electrical motor on
                each of the two front wheels, and one in the 8-speed transaxle that acts as a torque fill and power
                boost during shifting and launches, respectively.</p>
